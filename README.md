<h3 align="center">ToDo app in React</h3>

## Project Overview 🎉
It is my first React project and first posted on Github. I created simple todo app in which user can add, delete and search tasks. I organized the structure of the projects using atomic design, so I split my components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates and pages. For style, I used Styled-components and React-router-dom to switch between routes. I used context api to distribute state, which is in React. The application meets the PWA requirements, so it can be downloaded to a phone or computer.

## Installation 💾
Download the project to your computer and install needed packages with command:
```sh
npm install
```
Then start the project on the local server with the command:
```sh
npm start
```
and open http://localhost:3000/ to see this app.

## Tech/framework used 🔧

| Tech                                                    | Description                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| React                           | The framework in which I created this project. |
| Styled-components               | Great library for styling components in an application. The biggest advantage of this library is writing styles in js, so we can use conditional statements and other things from javascript there. |
| React-router-dom                | It's a library from the React ecosystem. It is used to switch between routes and many other things that I haven't used in this project. |
| Eslint, Prettier, Lint-staged and Hushy                           | These tools help keep code clean in project. |
